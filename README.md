# WibblyWires

An Unreal plugin that makes your Blueprint wires nice and wibbly.

Very serious plugin that should only be used for serious purposes.

(Note that this whole thing is very hacked together, and doesn't include the 'cutting' feature in the GIF since that needed engine changes)

Update: I finally made a PR for the cut/slice feature for those wanting to try it out (on non-wibbly wires no less!)

Though I do vaguely remember the spline bounds needing to be more conservative for the wibbly version

Released as MIT, though would appreciate it not being put on the marketplace, since I've thought about doing it myself eventually.
